- methods for all graphs
- code to write sequence's data to excel in results folder
- if empty then only run otherwise pick data from excel


* bash script will by default not pass any args to main.py
    so all scenarios will be computed - all graphs generated


* main.py will always compute at run time simulator data (and not plot it) --- only reponsibiity is simul data generation
* plot.py will always use csv files (both model and simulator) if present otherwise it will exit and print no file
