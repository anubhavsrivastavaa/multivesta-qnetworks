* until 5 swaps fidelity don't drop below threshold fidelity
* looking at existing qnt papers, look at metrics 
* evaluation of the simulator

What do we want to do?
* Use the model checker to ask non trivial queries about the simulator and that have physical significance
* Use the model checker to validate the simulator
* Use the model checker to validate protocols implemented on the simulator

Examples ->
* impact cc delay on entanglement dististribution and the quality of entanglements
* bursts - 

* counting failures at lower layers like generation/purification/swaps?



Components of a quantum network:
* A classical optical channel  -> length, attenuation
* A quantum optical channel -> length, attenuattion
* Quantum Memories -> 
* Light sources
* Detectors
* protocols at the higher layers
